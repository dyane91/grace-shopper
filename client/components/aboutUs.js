      <p>
        The world was stunned when the GH1904FS virus afflicted 30% of the
        population in April of 2019. Our noble scientific community scrambled to
        come up with a vaccine before mortality rates hit an all time high.
        Although the vaccine was successful in effectively curbing the epidemic,
        there was one significant side effect: Humans lost the ability to dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our innovative scientists at Grace Shopper, nicknamed the Blue
        Barracudas, united together to concoct "potions" that allow the everyday
        consumer to dream once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browse our selection of potions and be prepared to be amazed. Our dreams
        make for an unforgettable night and are wonderful gifts for your loved
        ones. We also offer a selection of nightmares that can be enjoyed by
        daredevils and nemeses alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're always constantly hard at work at developing a wider portfolio of
        dreams and nightmares. After all, life is too short not to dream.
